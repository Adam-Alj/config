# AwesomeWM Setup

This config assings different layouts to different monitors based on their orientation.

For this, we need to init the monitors in their respective orientations before this runs.

We use a `.xprofile` file to do so. Document [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xprofile)

Create a symlink, or copy the contents of [xrandr_setup](./xrandr_setup) to an `.xprofile` file in your user config dir.
